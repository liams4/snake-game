# Snake
This program replicates the game 'Snake' or 'Nibbles'. 
## How to install
To play the game, make sure that you have Python 3 and the
_Pygame_ module installed on your computer. Then, clone this
repository, navigate to it on a command prompt application
(e.g Command Prompt/Powershell on Windows or Terminal on Mac) and run
the command _python3 run\_game_ to start the game!
## How to play
The goal of Snake is to make your snake as big as possible without
running into the sides of the screen or your snake's own body. When you
eat food, your snake becomes longer and you score increases. Simply use
the arrow keys to change the direction in which your snake is moving.
