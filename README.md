# Snake
This program replicates the game 'Snake' or 'Nibbles'.
## How to install
To play the game, make sure that you have Python 3 and the
[_Pygame_](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) module installed on your computer. Then,
clone this repository, navigate to it on a CLI and run _run_game.py_ (e.g  `python3 run_game.py` on OS X)
to start the game!
## How to play
The goal of Snake is to make your snake as big as possible without
running into the sides of the screen or your snake's own body. When you
eat food, your snake becomes longer and you score increases. Simply use
the arrow keys to change the direction in which your snake is moving.
